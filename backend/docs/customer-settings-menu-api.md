- Icons use emoji characters for better visual representation
- The response includes metadata for versioning and debugging

## Frontend Integration

This endpoint is designed to replace the simple logout button with a comprehensive account menu. Frontend implementations should:

1. Call this endpoint when user clicks the account area
2. Render the menu sections in the specified order
3. Show badges when present 
4. Handle the logout action separately from other menu items
5. Use the quick actions for common shortcuts
